Of late, there has been emergence of the **4th pillar** of democracy, i.e. the media, as the parallel courts in India. It’s working on part of our 3rd pillar of democracy i.e. the Judiciary.  The news channels, whose primary work should be to provide the news as it is, have digressed from their path. News has been replaced by perception and judgement of the anchors (so called editors). Anchors are playing role of the judge's spokesman. 

The mainstream media channels have become a ground of heated, antagonistic and annoying debates on unwanted issues. Issues of national importance such as education, healthcare, employment and infrastructure are sidelined and they are neither focused upon nor debated. The news screens have been divided into 4-8 small boxes by including ill-tempered so-called panelists, thrashing and abusing each other, sometimes on political lines, live on television instead of debating on important issues. The moderator on the TV show is generally highly opinionated and oversees the debate with a clear bias for opinions that match his own. 

The focus of the media now-a-days is to divert people from talking about developmental issues to irrelevant and disputed issues. Many a times religion is used as a means to achieve this goal as religion has a soft corner in the heart of the common man. Indian media today are trapped by power centres, business tycoons and Indian state authorities converting their role of watchdog to lapdog, to which critics in India characterise as **‘godi media’**. They refrain from questioning the authority. 

At a time when India is grappling with COVID-19 pandemic, a shattered economy, floods in several parts of our country and all time high unemployment, the big media houses are engaged in  putting allegations on Rhea and his brother involved in drug trafficking. Catchy graphics, drama, fake actors and the words like “sabse badi khabar”, “sabse bada mudda”, “sabse tez channel”, are used to grab the attention of the viewers. While investigating agencies are still investigating, our media channels have already given the verdict. They portray unwanted stories as if they are the biggest breakthrough in the history of media. Analyzing and attacking the character of a dead person makes no sense at all. The degraded level of ethics of journalism can be seen during ground reporting with journalists mocking and harassing the interviewee with their unscrupulous questions. 

The fake narratives are created by the news channels to tarnish the image of the target person. Journalists are doing the job of a hitman, doing character asssination by media trials. Attempts are made to ill feed the society with fabricated and baseless information. They attempt to make good as bad and bad as good, criminal as a righteous and righteous as criminal. Fake stories are made just for the sake of TRP. From remoulding history to twisting the facts to manipulating the videos and comments by trimming and editing them and presenting them in a different perspective and out of context has become a normal for the media houses.  

Some Anchors on their Prime Time shows have repeatedly admitted that if people want to see a debate on developmental issues, they should go to print media, or refer other sources. Their own shows aren’t the platforms for serious issues that are bugging the citizens of our country day and night. There are some news channels like DD News, Rajya Sabha TV which shows quality news content and healthy debates by experts from different fields. As viewers we should follow news from reliable government sources only. We should not get trapped into the cobweb of negative journalism as it will pollute one from within and kill the logic and common sense of a person. We should use our own common sense and boycott such media houses which creates ruckus over TV. Don’t be an audience to such crap. 

It is high time that Indian media, media academics and journalists need to introspect their approach and bring out some holistic measures to uphold the fundamental principles of journalism to bring back the credibility of our media industry.
