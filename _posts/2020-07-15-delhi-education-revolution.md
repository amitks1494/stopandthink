School education is of paramount importance for the development of youth of any nation. It opens up new horizons of life, provides new aspirations and contributes towards the mental growth of children. This basic education decides the future of any student. 
According to the Department of Education, almost 60% of students are enrolled in over 1000 government schools in Delhi. Despite several efforts, the government school system was in shambles, the basic quality of education and infrastructure was not up to the mark. With sustained, systematic and persistent efforts mentioned below it was possible to repair and rebuild the broken public education system to a certain extent in the past 5 years. 

## Increase in education Budget 
Delhi government raised the budget for education in Delhi to about ~25% of the whole budget, which is around Rs. 15000 Crore in 2020.


## Infrastructure and Sanitation 
A broken down classroom often translates to broken self esteem. Infrastructure and sanitation facilities are necessary to create a conducive environment of learning. It is also important to maintain the dignity of teachers and students. It creates a better sense of self worth and enhances self confidence among students. So, the schools were renovated, new buildings were made. New sports facilities, playgrounds, libraries, toilets were constructed and renovated and also their cleanliness and maintenance was also assured. One can witness a remarkable difference in government school infrastructure as compared to earlier times. Delhi government schools have set a benchmark of excellence in infrastructure. 

## Fixing accountability
Involvement of parents in ***School Management Committees (SMCs)*** which are mandated under Right to Education Act, 2009. It gave push to decentralised monitoring and supervision. There is a SMC for every school with 75% members as parents out of the total 16 members. They are also provided with Rs. 5-7 lakhs of funds for routine maintenance in schools, and are empowered to regularly visit the school and inspect the Mid Day Meals, cleanliness and curriculum.

## Restructuring of classrooms 
Innovative learning methods were incorporated, smart classrooms are made, focus is given on activity oriented learning rather than rote learning. 

## Teacher recognition 
Award functions to motivate good efforts and hoardings were displayed with their photos on it all over Delhi. It gave motivation to others also to perform well. 

## Champions of change 
Every system has about 20-30% of cream. They need to be identified, nurtured and put to a better use. The same was done in Delhi government school. 

## Mega Parent Teacher Meetings (PTM) 
It made parents as the stakeholders in children's development, helped to bridge the communication gap between parents and teachers.

## Capacity building 
Increase in seats in government schools in Delhi from 17000 in 2015 to 36000 in 2020. 

## Reforms and Interventions for students :- 

**Happiness Curriculum** - to help students live happier life and practicing stress and anger management, meditation, mindfulness, and inculcate in them values such as empathy, compassion, critical thinking for socio-emotional development 

**Entrepreneurship mindset (For class 9th to 12th)** - Students get exposure to risk taking. Each child gets Rs. 1000 as seed money that they can spend to create a business, the additional profit is kept by students and the seed money is returned to the government after a couple of months. 

**Chunauti 2018 programme** - launched in 2016, aims to reduce the learning gaps, to have all students of 9th class to be able to read, write and do basic maths and attain learning outcomes appropriate to their grade level. OUTCOME - Pass percentage in class 9th improved from 52% in 2015-16 to 57% in 2017-18. 

**Mission Buniyad** - Similar to Chunauti programme for 3rd to 8th class students. 

**Reading Campaign** - One hour of focused reading activities were conducted daily. “Reading Melas” were organised by SMCs. OUTCOME - Nearly one lakh students of class 6,7,8 learnt to read their textbooks during the campaign. 

**Pragati Series** - creation of extra supplementary learning material by school teachers themselves to reduce dependence on guide books. This is in addition to NCERT books.

**Summer Camps** - to welcome incoming students of class 6th in school and make them do group activities, peer interactions so that they acclimatize with the school atmosphere. 

**Spoken English Classes** - Organised to enhance the english speaking skills of students 


## Other reforms and interventions for Teachers and Principals 
**Mentor teacher programme** - Mentor teachers are a cadre of 200 talented, dynamic and experienced teachers. Each mentor teacher has five to six schools assigned to them which they visit regularly to observe the classroom practice and provide on-site learning support to teachers.

**Principal Development Programme** - To provide training to Head of Schools to strengthen their leadership and management skills in India and abroad. Around 100 HoS went to Cambridge for training and 22 to Finland to know about the education systems of other countries. 

**Teachers training** - Focus was given on training teachers, they were sent to training in several reputed institutions in India and abroad. 

## Teamwork 
A good team is what it takes to bring out a positive outcome. The education team in Delhi included dedicated politicians, bureaucrats and certain advisors.


## Regulation of private schools 
Monitoring of fees structure was done and financial irregularities in private schools were removed/rectified. Admission of underprivileged students in private schools was done though computerised lottery systems to maintain transparency. 

## Key takeaways 
If there is a will, there is a way. The political will is utmost important to drive the change. As they are the policy makers and primary agents of change. 

Any reform takes “right people to be in the right decision making positions” 

Change in public perception about government schools took place over a period of time. This will set good precedence for the future. 

Quality education should be the right of every child. Education should not be divided on the line of several divides already present in society. 

There is a need to move from rote learning to conceptual understanding, as only scoring good marks is not sufficient, learning should preside over craving for marks.

Similar models can also be applied in the whole of India with need based modifications. 

Change is a continuous process. Positive change should keep going on in future. 

Over the years, there have been improvements in the pass percentage of XIIth class students -- in 2016 - 85.9%, 2017 - 88.2%, 2018 - 90.6 %, 2019 - 94.24% and in 2020: 98% students passed in Delhi government schools, as per reports by government.
