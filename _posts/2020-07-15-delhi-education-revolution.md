School education is of paramount importance for the development of youth of any nation. It opens up new horizons of life, provides new aspirations and contributes towards the mental growth of children. This basic education decides the future of any student. 
According to the Department of Education, almost 60% of students are enrolled in over 1000 government schools in Delhi. Despite several efforts, the government school system was in shambles, the basic quality of education and infrastructure was not up to the mark. With sustained, systematic and persistent efforts mentioned below the broken public education system was repaired and rebuilt to a certain extent in the past five years. 

## Increase in education Budget 
Delhi government raised the budget for education in Delhi to approximately ~25% of the whole budget. In 2015-16, the budget was Rs. 6208 Cr, in 2016-17 it was Rs. 8642 Cr, in 2017-18 it allotted Rs. 9,888 Cr, in 2018-19 it was Rs. 11,201 Cr, and which went up to Rs. 15,815 Crore in 2020.

## Infrastructure and Sanitation 
A broken down classroom often translates to a broken self esteem. Infrastructure and sanitation facilities are necessary to create a conducive environment for learning. It is also important to maintain the dignity of teachers and students. It creates a better sense of self worth and enhances self confidence among students. So, the schools were renovated, new buildings were made. 

New sports facilities, playgrounds, libraries, toilets were constructed and renovated and also their cleanliness and maintenance was also assured. One can witness a remarkable difference in government school infrastructure as compared to earlier times. Delhi government schools have set a benchmark of excellence in infrastructure. 

## Fixing accountability
Involvement of parents in ***School Management Committees (SMCs)*** was mandated under Right to Education Act, 2009. It gave a push to decentralised monitoring and supervision. Every school has an SMC with a total of 16 members, out of which 75% are parents. Each SMC is provided with Rs. 5-7 lakhs of funds for routine maintenance in schools, and are empowered to regularly visit the school and inspect the Mid Day Meals, cleanliness and curriculum.

## Restructuring of classrooms 
Innovative learning methods were incorporated, smart classrooms are made, focus is given on activity oriented learning rather than rote learning. 
 

## Champions of change 
The teachers who are bringing a postive change with their efforts need to be identified, nurtured and rewarded. Award functions are organised annually to give recognition to good efforts of teacher and hoardings are displayed with their photos and achievements on it, all over Delhi. It gave motivation to other teachers to raise the bar and perform well.

## Mega Parent Teacher Meetings (PTM) 
It made parents as the stakeholders in children's development, helped to bridge the communication gap between parents and teachers.

## Capacity building 
Increase in seats in government schools in Delhi from 17000 in 2015 to 36000 in 2020. 

## Reforms and Interventions for students :- 

**Happiness Curriculum** - To help students live happier life and practice stress and anger management, meditation, mindfulness, and inculcate in them values such as empathy, compassion, critical thinking for socio-emotional development 

**Entrepreneurship mindset (For class 9th to 12th)** - Students get exposure to risk taking. Each child gets Rs. 1000 as seed money that they can spend to create a business, the additional profit is kept by students and the seed money is returned to the government after a couple of months. 

**Chunauti 2018 programme** - launched in 2016, aims to reduce the learning gaps, to have all students of 9th class to be able to read, write and do basic maths and attain learning outcomes appropriate to their grade level. OUTCOME - Pass percentage in class 9th improved from 52% in 2015-16 to 57% in 2017-18. 

**Mission Buniyad** - Similar to Chunauti programme for 3rd to 8th class students. 

**Reading Campaign** - One hour of focused reading activities were conducted daily. “Reading Melas” were organised by SMCs. OUTCOME - Nearly one lakh students of class 6th ,7th ,8th learnt to read their textbooks during the campaign. 

**Pragati Series** - creation of extra supplementary learning material by school teachers themselves to reduce dependence on guide books. This is in addition to NCERT books.

**Summer Camps** - to welcome incoming students of class 6th in school and make them do group activities, peer interactions so that they acclimatize with the school atmosphere. 

**Spoken English Classes** - Organised to enhance the english speaking skills of students 


## Other reforms and interventions for Teachers and Principals

**Teachers training** - Focus was given on training teachers, they were sent to training in several reputed institutions in India and abroad. 

## Teamwork 
A good team is what it takes to bring out a positive outcome. The education team in Delhi included dedicated politicians, bureaucrats and certain advisors.


## Regulation of private schools 
Monitoring of fees structure was done and financial irregularities in private schools were removed/rectified. Admission of underprivileged students in private schools was done through computerised lottery systems to maintain transparency. 

## Key takeaways 
If there is a will, there is a way. The political will is utmost important to drive the change. As they are the policy makers and primary agents of change. 

Any reform takes “right people to be in the right decision making positions” 

Change in public perception about government schools took place over a period of time. This will set good precedence for the future. 

Quality education should be the right of every child. Education should not be divided on the line of several divides already present in society. 

There is a need to move from rote learning to conceptual understanding, as only scoring good marks is not sufficient, learning should preside over craving for marks.

Similar models can also be applied in the whole of India with need based modifications. 

Change is a continuous process. Positive change should keep going on in future. 

Over the years, there have been improvements in the pass percentage of XIIth class students -- in 2016 - 85.9%, 2017 - 88.2%, 2018 - 90.6 %, 2019 - 94.24% and in 2020: 98% students passed in Delhi government schools, as per reports by government. 

## Major Challenges 
**Fall in enrollment rate** - According to the Praja Foundation report, ‘State of Public (School) Education in Delhi’, published in March 2019, enrolment rate in Delhi government schools has fallen by 8% from 2013-14 to 2017-18. In government schools, the enrolment rate for Class I saw a decrease of 4.8% in 2017-18.

**Poor Retention** - A survey by Praja Foundation shows that out of 2,59,705 students enrolled in class IX in Delhi government schools in 2014-15, 56% did not reach class XII in 2017-18. 

**Deficit of Teachers** - According to Delhi Economic Survey, 2019, the government schools have only 57% regular teachers, while rest of them are guest teachers. 

## Conclusion 
With upgraded infrastructure facilities and increased education budget, a platform has been created for advancement in the Education sector in Delhi. With all these efforts, it will take another 5-10 years to achieve the desired outcomes. There is a need to address the challenges for inclusive growth. The battle of the education revolution is only half won.
