2020 is by far the most horrible and dreadful year that the current generation is witnessing. It is filled with unprecedented catastrophes, both natural and anthropogenic - from Corona pandemic to death of celebrities to police brutalities to jungle fires and many more. Past 6-7 months have left many people hopeless with loss of jobs, loss of mobility, mental health issues amidst other problems. The economy worldwide is creeping under pressures. Here are some events that occurred in 2020 so far that made it appear a year of darkness.

![COVID-19 Pandemic](/assets/images/yearofdarkness2020/covid_19_pandemic.jpg)

## 1. COVID-19 Pandemic
The first outbreak of Corona was identified in **December 2019** in **Wuhan, China**. The first death due to Corona was reported by China on 11th Jan, 2020. On Mar 11, 2020 WHO declared Coronavirus a pandemic. Worldwide, as on 8th Aug, 2020, with approximately 20 million cases, and 0.73 million deaths and counting, it has created havoc. Complete lockdown was imposed in several parts of the world starting Feb 2020, and is still in continuation partly. USA, Brazil and India occupy top three positions respectively, in terms of total no. of cases. All of a sudden everything came to a halt - schools, gyms, tourism, public transport, offices, industries etc. 

The trauma of illness - due to its insane symptoms, fear of aerial transmission and compulsory quarantine for affected people, disturbs the patients and his closed ones physically, mentally as well as financially. Sadness, anxiety, depression types of problems started increasing due to imposition of lockdown. Old age people and persons with comorbidities (such as diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, Asthma etc.) are more vulnerable to this disease.  

It led to behavioural changes in human beings. Physical distancing, wearing a mask, practicing good hand hygiene, staying at home has become a common norm. The shattered economy will take a long time to reboot itself with phased relaxation of lockdown. Still there is no vaccine available for treatment of Coronavirus. Experts are working constantly to develop the vaccine. We can just pray that the situation comes under control by the end of this year.

## 2. Desert Locust Attack (May 2020)
Locust swarms caused damage to food grains and vegetables which might lead to famine and food security issues. Although locust attacks are not new. But this year it came at an unprecedented time. They were generally restricted to Rajasthan, but this year they migrated to nearby 5 States ie. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Generally locusts attack in the monsoon season. The locust swarms are found in East Africa, Asia and the Middle East. 

It is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world. Locusts are not dangerous as long as they are isolated or in small groups. Problems happen when they accumulate in large numbers and start forming swarms. A single swarm contains up to **40-80 million** adults in 1 sq. km and these can travel up to **150 km** in one day. According to some evidence, a small swarm (1 sq. km) can consume the same amount of food in one day as 35,000 people, while a large swarm can eat up to 1.8 million metric tons of green vegetation, equivalent to food enough to feed 81 million people. With the ongoing Corona pandemic, the locust crisis created a crisis within a crisis.

## 3. Assam gas leak (27th May 2020)
Also called as Tinsukia gas leak or Baghjan gas leak, happened in Oil India Limited’s Baghjan oil fields. It started with leaking of Natural gas and oil condensate from oil wells, followed by a blowout, which later caught fires. The fire was so intense that it could be seen even from 10 kms away. Around 3,000 people were evacuated and sheltered in 14 relief camps, as the fires damaged their houses and crops. The fire and oil also affected the nearby lakes and wetlands, also there were reports of death of a Dolphin and other sea animals. 

The oil condensate is a mix of propane, methane, propylene and other gases - which is moving with the wind towards North East and falling on bamboo, tea gardens and on **Dibru-Saikhowa National Park**  too. Professor S. K. Lahiri of Dibrugarh university has cited many possible reasons for blowout such as “bad maintenance, poor workmanship, lack of attention, old age of wells etc”.

## 4. Russia Oil Spill (29th May, 2020)
According to Nornickel, around **20,000** tonnes of diesel fuel spilled out of a collapsed oil storage tank in a power plant near Norilsk in Russia. The oil spilled on to the nearby ground and the Ambarnaya river, turning it into crimson red colour. The river flows into the eco-sensitive Arctic Ocean. According to investigators, the tank sank because of thawing permafrost, which weakened its pile supports, causing damage to the bottom of the tank. Experts said that clean up could take anywhere between 5 to 10 years. According to preliminary data, the spill will cost $145 million to clean up. This oil spill is believed to be the second largest in modern Russian history in terms of volume after the 1994 Komi Pipeline spill. The toxins will remain in the soil and water, eventually enter into the food chain and cause health problems for all.

## 5. Beirut Blast (4th Aug, 2020)
Around 2750 tonnes of **Ammonium Nitrate**, a chemical fertilizer, which was seized and kept in Beirut since 2013, exploded leading to huge loss to infrastructure and lives of people. Ammonium Nitrate is a hazardous substance, often used in mining or construction as an explosive. Some termed blast as the "blast of the century". The impact of the blast was so much so that it could be heard in Cyprus, more than 200 km away from Beirut. A mushroom cloud formed due to sudden release of hot gases. The US Geological Survey said the explosion in Beirut created seismic waves equal to a magnitude **3.3** Earthquake. The terrifying video footage left everyone in shock. This catastrophe could have been averted if the stockpile of Ammonium Nitrate would have been disposed off timely and safely.

## 6. Australian Bush fires
Although started in late 2019, it continued upto February 2020. The deadly and erratic bushfires were caused due to increased temperature, heat waves and months of severe droughts in Australia. South-East Australia is worst hit. According to BBC reports, more than **11 million hectares** (1,10,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres, equivalent to the size of South Korea) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned - killing at least 33 people including 4 firefighters. According to an estimate from the University of Sydney, more than 1 billion mammals, birds, and reptiles likely lost their lives in the blazes, Around **25,000 koalas** were feared dead. Black soot travelled far distances and affected air quality in New zealand too. The black soot is very harmful and devastating for the environment. The megafires and its plume have the capacity to make its own weather.

## 7. George Floyd’s murder (25th May, 2020)
The murder of George Floyd, a black American, by police personnel in Minneapolis, and that too publically, has once again triggered the debate on aparthied and racism. **"Black Lives Matter"** movement again got invigorated - it is a movement advocating non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against African-American people. Floyd kept gasping for **8 mins and 46 seconds**, but the three policemen strangled him brutally to death, with their knee on his neck and body. There were widespread protests against police brutality, all over the United States. People came in support of black people. The police also apologized publicly by bowing down in front of black people.

## 8. Death of famous Celebrities

We lost some famous celebrities such as **Irrfan Khan** (the most naturalist actor), **Rishi Kapoor** (the evergreen actor), **Wajid Khan** (bollywood music composer), **Sushant Singh Rajput** (the young talent of bollywood), his death has created controversy and started debate on nepotism in Bollywood.
