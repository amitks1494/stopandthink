What happens when you are devoid of withdrawing your hard earned money, that you saved and deposited into your bank account for safety ? How does it feel when you find that your money is being used to fund fraudulent luxuries ? The sheer pain of betrayal by a bank leaves the depositors with anger, frustration and often leads to suicides. 

The PMC fraud case is one such incident. 

## About PMC Bank
PMC is a Urban Cooperative Bank (UCB), with operations in 7 states i.e. Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Goa, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It was founded in 1984 as a single branch in Mumbai, and now has a total 136 branches and around 16 lakh depositors. It’s total loans stand at around 9,000 crore and the deposits at over Rs 11,610 crore.  It’s customers include small businesses, housing societies and institutions.

## What is the Scam/Fraud ?
PMC bank scam is related to irregularities in certain loan accounts. The Bhandup branch of PMC bank lent around ***73%*** (approx Rs 6500 Crores) of its total loans (approx Rs. 8880 Crores) to a real estate company Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), owned by Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang Wadhawan. These are against the lending norms of banks. The company defaulted on the loans of around ***Rs. 4355 Crores*** and yet the bank didn’t classify them as NPA’s. 

According to RBI, the PMC bank masked ***44 problematic loan accounts***, including HDIL, using special codes and by tampering with its Core Banking System, with limited staff access to those accounts. 

HDIL employees colluded with PMC managers and the bank created ***21,049 dummy accounts*** to divide the bad loans into multiple accounts so as to avoid any speculations of big default. The bad loans were not reported to RBI for fear of reputational risk. 

They also ***created fake reports*** to avoid regulatory supervision. In 2018-19, the bank had reported a net profit of Rs 99.69 crore in its annual report. The bank showed 3.76 % (or Rs 315 crore) of its total loans (Rs 8,383 crore) as gross NPAs, which was a good performance as compared to public-sector banks. 

## How it started ?
As per statements of Former PMC Bank MD Joy Thomas HDIL was a major business giver of the PMC Bank. 

The PMC bank’s relationship with HDIL started in 1986-87, when HDIL and many other companies came to the rescue of the PMC bank as it was on the brink of closure due to default by some borrowers. 
Again, in 2004, Rakesh’s elder brother Rajesh Wadhawan deposited more than Rs 100 Crore to help the bank to overcome the liquidity crunch. After that HDIL started banking with PMC and more than 60 % transactions of the bank were from HDIL.

Between 2011 and 2013, HDIL suffered a series of business setbacks and they started defaulting on bank loans. The bank didn’t take much collateral against the loans during 2008-2017 from HDIL. PMC bank extended an overdraft facility of about Rs. 2000 crores to HDIL due to old ties with the company. 

Due to fear of loss of reputation and profitability the PMC bank continued to report all accounts as standard accounts. Having fears of regulatory actions from RBI, they didn’t bring it to the notice of the Board. The auditors also didn’t interfere much and believed whatever they reported. 

## How it came to light ?
Due to information provided by some ***whistleblowers*** to the RBI, it came to their notice. The issue got highlighted after on ***24th Sep, 2019***, the day RBI placed a moratorium (a temporary prohibition of an activity) on the PMC bank for 6 months. 

## Regulatory restrictions by RBI
As RBI had placed a moratorium on the bank. It cannot grant or renew any loans, neither can accept new deposits. The RBI also limited the amount a customer could withdraw from their account during the next 6 months - to Rs 1,000 at first, which later extended to Rs 50,000 in November 2019 and subsequently to Rs. 1 lakh in June 2020. With this relaxation 84% of the bank's depositors will be able to withdraw their entire account balance. The regulatory restrictions will continue to be in place till **December 2020**. 

The RBI also superseded the board and the management of the bank and appointed an ex-RBI official as the administrator at the bank. 

## Investigations so far
Mumbai Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) is probing the case against management of PMC and HDIL promoters. The case for forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy was filed on the basis of a complaint by RBI-appointed administrator.  

ED has filed a money laundering case against the Bank. The officials are booked under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  About 15 officials have been arrested so far to inquire into the case.

## PMC Bank - HDIL Linkages
PMC bank’s former chairman Waryam Singh holds 1.9% of HDIL’s stocks. He was a non-executive director of HDIL in 2015-17, at the time when the bank gave large loans to the company. 

Many borrowers are promoters of the multiple companies linked to HDIL. 

## Impact of Scam
On other private banks - People lost faith in private banks and withdrew their money amidst fear, lowering their business. 

On Depositors → affecting lakhs of customers who faced difficulty in withdrawing their money due to restrictions imposed by the RBI. 

## Why cooperative banks face problems in India ?
***Dual regulation*** - Cooperative banks are registered with the Registrar of Cooperative Societies which control the management and administration; and are also regulated by RBI - which grants license and oversees its activities. This duality often leads to weak oversight and supervision. 

Politicians usually get their representatives elected over the board of directors in order to gain undue advantages. 

## RBI and its powers
Earlier RBI had no powers for reconstruction or amalgamation of a cooperative bank. 

After PMC crisis, amendments were made to ***Banking Regulation Act*** which empowers the RBI to frame an enforceable reconstruction scheme for co-operative banks, just like it does in the case of commercial banks (like YES Bank), even without making an order of moratorium, so as to avoid disruption of the financial system. 

## Conclusion 
Poor governance, fraudulent practices, supervisory failures and political economy climate allows, even encourages, loans to favoured parties. 

There is a need for increasing professionalism to judge the viability of projects, and improving governance and oversight for sound banking through the RBI. 

The deposit insurance coverage limit should be increased further (upto Rs. 20-25 Lakhs). Although the limit was raised from Rs. 1 lakh to 5 Lakh in Feb 2020, it fails to cover the loss of depositors. 

Corporate governance needs to be given greater importance. 

After COVID-19 pandemic, fully digital banks should also be given greater thrust.

Government should give assurance to depositors that their money will be returned, with a cutoff date.

We must prefer to have an account in big banks, as they have lower chances of default. Or one can open multiple accounts and not rely only on one bank, as a safety measure.
