## Introduction

Rich Dad Poor Dad talks about the importance of financial literacy in one’s life. It offers insights based upon real life experiences. The story has 2 fathers - one educated, degree holder and yet relatively poor; the other one is a high school dropout and rich. As a kid, Robert got lessons about money from his rich dad (the father of his best friend Mike) and about a stable career and idea of scholarly education from his poor dad (his biological father). Since childhood he got exposure to both ways of earning money and being successful - the traditional method of working hard and getting a secure job, requiring formal education, the other way is to take some financial risks in life and investing money in business, stocks, mutual funds, real estate sector etc., where having any sort of formal education is not an eligibility criteria to match. This contrasting perspective of both the fathers is shared very beautifully and in an engaging, thought provoking manner. The poor dad tells him "I cannot afford it", while the rich dad teaches him "How to afford it". He points out where his poor dad made mistakes in life and remained poor. 


## Learnings and Insights 

Robert says that the professional success is no longer solely linked to academic success, as it once was. **Financial literacy** is important as it creates intelligence and intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone. Our current educational system needs change to match the global and technological advancements in the world today. Both scholastic and financial skills should be taught at school level. A person can be highly educated, professionally successful and financially illiterate. We should first of all focus on educating our mind. It's what in your head that determines what is in your hands. Money is only an idea.


Further the book tells about the science of making money. He told ways to **utilize the power of money to work for you, instead of working for money.** The rich don't work for money, they have money to work for them. Workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so that workers won't quit. We should **work to learn.** 

We should **focus on acquiring assets and not the liabilities.** Asset is defined in this book as something which generates cash flow, which brings money into your pocket. A liability is something which takes money out of your pocket. Talking about the trends of spending he says - if you spend foolishly, you will be poor, if you spend on liabilities, you join the middle class and if you invest in assets, you create worth and join the elite class. One should keep his spending and debts to a minimum.

Rich people buy luxury last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. Rich do invent money. **Financial IQ** is made up of 4 broad areas of expertise - Accounting, Investment strategy, Market understanding, knowledge of law. Accounting helps us to analyze everything in numbers. The knowledge of investment helps one to smartly invest the money to create capital. One needs to master the law of supply and demand in the market. The laws can be used in one’s favour if we can find a loophole in it, or use them in our favour.

There are 5 common **obstacles** in life - Fear, Cynicism, Laziness, Bad Habits, Arrogance. People are so afraid of losing that they lose. Winning means being unafraid to lose. Failure inspires winners, and failure defeats losers. Doubt is expensive. If you have doubts then start early and  start small. Don't play it safe, play it smart, and take action. We employ laziness by staying busy. Guilt is worse than greed. Habits control our behaviour. Arrogance is the summation of ego and ignorance. Don’t think that you know everything, just listen to others too !

One should build **self confidence** and should get away from the fear of rejection. Success has no shortcuts. Your ability to bounce back will bring you success, not your desire to succeed immediately. You need to identify an opportunity that no one has spotted.  

Some **other valuable suggestions** from Robert are - Choose your friends wisely who are creative and are not polluting you with their wasteful thoughts and ideas, find yourself a mentor and act like him or her everyday, give and you will receive back (it is the law of attraction in action), put your free will to test everyday, learn a lesson about your finances, cultivate self discipline, always look out for new ideas, think big and learn from the history and our ancestors, draw inspiration from biography of billionaires, mind your own business. 


## Conclusion

The book opens up different avenues of life and money making. It changed my perception of money and wealth. The notion of investment in assets, and not in liabilities is worth a praise. 

All throughout the book, the writer has tried to put the crux of the matter in a very simple way, by providing real life examples to explain the complete scenario. But somewhere the real-life examples given in the book are hard to follow. The author is too critical of those who earn their living working as an employee in any Organisation. He has paid much more respect to those who own their own business. This seemed a bit insulting towards the professionals who work throughout their life to become a master of their profession. 

If you never had any exposure to financial literacy, then this can give you a nice idea to ponder upon. And to start at least thinking in terms of finances. But if you are looking for minute details on the process of investment, then this book is not for you as the very details of the art of making money is not provided herewith.  The book is worth reading once to have a vague idea of how money can work for you. 


   I would rate the book to be **9/10**.
