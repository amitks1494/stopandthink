UGC issued ***“Revised Guidelines on Examinations and Academic Calendar for the Universities in view of COVID-19 Pandemic”*** on 6th July, 2020. It said that “the universities are required to complete the **terminal semesters/ final years** examinations by the end of September, 2020 in offline (pen & paper)/ online/ blended (online + offline) mode following the prescribed protocols/ guidelines related to COVID-19”. 

UGC has given rationale that it is important to provide students with fair and equal opportunity to perform and exams are important as they give confidence to students and ensure academic credibility. 

At the same time, exams for students, other than in final year, are not mandatory. They can be assessed on the basis of previous results and through internal evaluation. 

Firstly, we must understand that we have adopted a “Choice based Credit System” in our universities. So each and every semester carries equal weightage and is equally important. The final year exam is not an “exit” exam. So, mandating exams for only final year students seems illogical. 

Secondly, students are provided education in the classroom, and then on the basis of that education they are tested in the exam. Since there had been no classes, on what basis they would be tested? Though some online classes were conducted, they were no less than a “macchi bazaar” with students making mockery of the classes by making unwanted noises, singing, chattering in between. Also, due to the digital divide only a few students could attend online classes. 

Thirdly, such a pandemic is an extraordinary event/situation and happens once in a century or so. Extraordinary circumstances requires extraordinary efforts. The safety and health of students should be at par with the academic endeavours which necessitates travelling and public gathering in COVID times, risking lives of everyone (as they might catch infection). 

Fourthly, there are multiple ways of assessment and evaluation of students. Conducting exams in pen-paper/online mode is not the only way. For example, most of the IITs and other premier institutions have formulated strategies of assessment on the basis of take home assignments, assessing on past best performance, internal assessment etc. And also providing students an option of appearing in exams at a further date if they are unsatisfied with their evaluation, thus also giving them a fair opportunity. 

Fifthly, while there has been too much hew and cry over examinations, no effort is being done for industrial placements of final year students. 

Lastly, such uniform imposition of rules and regulations are counter productive and gives birth to needless complications. India is at third in the world in terms of COVID infections with over one million cases as on 16th July, 2020. Students are apprehensive as to what if COVID cases increase in future and their area lies in a containment zone, then how they will appear for the exam? 

However, most of the states such as Punjab, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal and Delhi have decided to go against the UGC decision and not conduct exams in their State Universities. 

The decision to evaluate and assess students should be done deliberately so as to avoid the risk of infection and not put extra burden on the shoulders of already worried students in such uncertain times. 

> Do you also think that examinations should be considered the only yardstick of learning during such a pandemic ?
