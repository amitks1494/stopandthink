Lately there has been enough evidence of hate mongering within the country. We need to understand that we will have to identify and differentiate those perpetrators of crime and not generalise our hatred towards the whole community or demonise that group as a whole. Unless we stop making such generalisations we will end up creating a false image of ***“every Muslim (for say Minorities) as a terrorist, every Communist as a Naxalite, every liberal an Urban Naxal, all Sadhus as Dhongis and everyone who questions the government as an Anti-National”***, thus setting out wrong prejudices in our society. 

Having said that ***“ek gandi machli sare talaab ko ganda kar deti hai"***. There are 10-20% such people in every religion, community, country, every profession and in every society who are involved in acts of atrocity and negligence which leads to endangering the lives of innocents in that group. Those nasty elements must be punished and penalised within the purview of law and by lawful authorities. Taking law in our hand is itself a crime (For ex. mob lynchings), for we are a part of the civilised society. 

Whereas our honourable Prime Minister and President are constantly urging people to maintain equality and remain united, on the other hand there are some in power who are openly sowing seeds of differences on religious and communal lines on live TV channels. I personally feel that such people do not even qualify to be a part of debate and should be boycotted. Still, they are being called in for debates on media channels. We should not be caught in such petty politics and restrain ourselves from being a part of violence. 

Amidst all this, there are those who have been serving the society, nation and humanity despite grave risks to their lives. We should be tolerant towards them and at least praise their efforts so as to motivate them further. The mainstream media should also display examples of such ***“leaders of change”*** in the society so as to set a good precedent. 

"For hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that". The hate mongers further hate. As our moral duty, we should strive towards making our surroundings a better place to live by warding off hatred towards fellow citizens. What is important is to create a learning environment that encourages critical inquiry and ethics of care. We should be able to ***look beyond limited identities, be compassionate*** and experience our shared community and embrace the ‘Unity in Diversity’ of our country. It's time that all of us understand and perform our duties of upholding and respecting the ideals & values of our Constitution and abide by the laws & regulations of our country. 

Least we can do on our part is to stop the circulation of videos, text messages spreading hatred and prevent rumours to spread in society on various social media platforms and report them to the adequate authorities. 

Finally I quote Kennedy ***"ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"***.
