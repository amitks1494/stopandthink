This environment day, the world is witnessing probably the worst nightmare that one could ever imagine i.e. 
**Corona Crisis**. 

**Is Corona Crisis anthopogenic ??**

I would say yes, to a great extent.

Due to the interference and encroachment of human into the natural habitat of animals, insects and other living beings to fulfill their pursuit of desires (of fancy food habits) and greediness.

The mother nature have its own ways to maintain balance in the environment. The human's quest to control nature, and exploit resources merely for profit is being wiped out by an invisible biological organism. Killing around 4 lakh people till now, and causing setback to economies worldwide. 

Amidst other continuing problems such as global warming, plastic pollution, Ozone layer depletion, sea level rise etc. It's still not too late to acknowledge the disaster caused to the nature and start making efforts for betterment. This lockdown period has given us a chance to introspect and think for our environment, for we are just a part of the same environment.

Increasing green cover, reducing Carbon Footprint, waste water treatment, reduced usage of plastic, changing food habits, showing compassion (& not cruelty) towards other living beings would pave the way for sustainable future.
