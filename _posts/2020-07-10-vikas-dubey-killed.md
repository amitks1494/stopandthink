A dreaded criminal and wanted gangster who had over 60 police cases registered against him was killed in a retaliatory police shootout when he tried to flee away from the police custody, while he was being transferred from Ujjain to Kanpur after being arrested in Ujjain. 

## Conspiracy Theories on Dubey's death/killing :-

**Scenario 1** : Dubey ji actually tried to escape from the custody of police after one of the three vehicles taking  him from Ujjain to Kanpur toppled in Bhauti area near Kanpur city and he snatched a gun of a cop and got killed in a shootout. 

**Scenario 2** : The police personnel were highly self motivated to end the story of Vikas Dubey in vengeance of the killing of 8 policemen recently in Bikru village ambush. 

**Scenario 3** : Allegedly a politically connected person, the living Vikas Dubey could possibly be a threat to the burgeoning politician's career. So got killed on high command orders. 

Any one of these could be possible. 


## Why encounter can be considered to favoured in Dubey case ?

Slow justice delivery system in India made people skeptical whether justice would actually be delivered eventually. So for such a dreaded criminal, encounter is thought of as a way out for punishment. 

Some top class gangsters often enjoy a lavish life even in jail and they even operate their business sitting in jail itself. 

Criminals often get out of jail due to political patronage and by exploiting legal loopholes. 


## Why is encounter not the best way to justice delivery ? 

Those who granted him protection and shielded him from being caught by police all along will also go free. The alleged criminal-politicians nexus can not be exposed now. 

Encounters prima facie appears to be a “quick justice delivery system” but it is not for the executive to give punishment, it's the judiciary that delivers the justice in pursuance of law. 

Quick justice can’t be thought of as a complete justice.

It can be considered a case of a planned custodial murder. 


## Ending views.….. 

Given that Vikas Dubey was a wanted murderer and a renowned criminal, he ultimately had to meet this fate. If the incidents as being told by the police are true, then it was the only option left with the police as they had to defend themselves too. 

But if it is a cocktail only, then the way out would have been to hold his trial in a fast track court, so that at least the names of those could be revealed who were backing him. As he was only a pawn in the hands of the powerful who plays the actual criminal games. 

The chor-police story doesn’t end with the death of Dubey. The police must look out for his remains and question his other partners who are still alive. 

Such incidents, in some cases, might also set a wrong precedent among the police officials and they may be more tempted to deliver justice on their own (by methods of encounter, custodial beating etc.). This must be taken care of diligently. 

***Jai Hind !!***
