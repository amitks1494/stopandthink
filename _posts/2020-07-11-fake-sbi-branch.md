We are born and brought up hearing the stories of fake notes, fake accounts, bank runs, money laundering, ATM theft, Cyber crimes and all other economic frauds related to banks. But ever heard of ***“a mischievous startup idea”*** of setting up a ***fake bank branch*** of an existing branch ? This trio of Kamal Babu (19), A Kumar(42), M Manickam (52) from Tamil Nadu made it possible. They set up a fake duplicate SBI branch in Panruti Bazar in Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu.

Kamal Babu is son of 2 former SBI employees, who brought computers, lockers, challans and other forged documents, the second one accused of works in the printing press where all documents and challans were printed, the third accused was involved in making rubber stamps. The branch was set up in April amid lockdown and it looked like a carbon copy of the existing original branch in the Panruti Bazar. 

They ran the branch successfully for almost three months, before getting caught. The issue came to notice when the branch manager of the original bank came to know about it through a customer. When the real SBI manager went to inquire about it he was shocked and surprised to find the exact similar setup having all necessary infrastructure to run a bank.

According to Police reports, Kamal Babu’s father passed away 10 years ago, his mother also retired from SBI two years ago.. He applied for the post of his father, but due to delay in processing of application he got frustrated and decided to open his own bank branch. Since childhood, he used to go to banks, so he knew all the operations of banks. 

It seems that they took the idea of ***“Atmanirbhar Bharat”*** too seriously even before our Prime Minister Modi announced it on May 12. 

The three accused have been booked under sections 473, 469, 484, and 109  of the Indian Penal Code, which are related to forgery, counterfeiting, maligning the reputation of an organisation, abetment in crime  etc. 

According to local media reports, Kamal told that he didn’t want to cheat anyone. He just wanted his own bank branch. Police also claim that so far no customer has reported any money loss in the branch.
