## Production and Consumption

With the discovery of plastic about 150 years ago the new prospects opened up to create a variety of synthetic products which replaced glass and metals. Since the invention of *Bakelite* in 1907, the commercial use of plastic has increased. The plastic products are cheap, versatile, lightweight and easy to make and are used in several industries such as in packaging, construction, healthcare etc. According to a report by Geyer (2017), the world plastic production has increased from **2 million tonnes** in 1950 to around **381 million tonnes** in 2015 i.e approximately ***200 times.*** The single use plastics used for packaging and disposables constitute about 50% of the plastic produced.

According to a report by FICCI in 2017, India's per capita consumption is **11 kg** (in 2015), while the world average was 28 kg. The cult of use and throw of single use plastics is proving bane for our environment

## Plastic Pollution

Plastic pollution refers to the accumulation of mismanaged, uncollected, synthetic, non-biodegradable plastic waste in the environment in such a quantity that it becomes hazardous to the living beings especially wildlife and aquatic species. According to CPCB, Plastic makes up about **8%** of total solid waste in India. India generates **9.4 Million tonnes** of plastic waste every year (Approx 26000 tonnes per day).

With rapid urbanization, spread of retail chains, plastic packaging from grocery to food and vegetable products, to cosmetics and consumer items the demand of plastic has increased. 

> *The production of plastic is not a nuisance, but the mismanagement of the discarded plastic waste is.*

Worldwide, about **300 million tonnes** of plastic waste is produced each year. It is spread across all altitudes to latitudes on Earth. Plastic packaging accounts for about half of the plastic waste in the world.

## Why is it a Hazard ?

The plastic litter never disappears so easily. It shreds into smaller pieces via *photo-degradation* and in this process it leaches out toxic chemicals like Bisphenol A, PCBs etc. 

> *It takes around 400 years to decompose a plastic bottle.*

According to recent estimates worldwide, 79% of the plastic waste ever produced now sits in landfills, dumps or in the environment, while about 12% has been incinerated and only 9% has been recycled. 

> *In India, 60% of plastic waste is recycled while 40% remains uncollected.*

## Impact 

The plastic waste leads to choking of streams, causes hindrance to photosynthesis in oceans and significant hazards to aquatic wildlife. It also impacts health of living beings as toxic chemicals and microbeads enters the food chain upon ingestion of plastic waste by turtles, dolphin and cows who mistake it for food, having adverse effects on their nervous, respiratory and reproductive systems, On burning of plastic waste, toxic fumes such as furans and dioxins are emitted into environment which are harmful for immune system and can cause cancer.

As per Ellen MacArthur Foundation report, around **32%** of plastic packaging escapes the collection system, generating significant economic costs - by reducing the productivity of vital natural systems such as clogging of urban infrastructure. 

> *The externalities due to Greenhouse Gas emissions from  plastic production and its after use cost is estimated to be around $40 Billion annually - which exceeds the plastic packaging industry’s profit pool.*

In future this cost needs to be recovered.

## Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016

It was an attempt by Indian government to tackle plastic waste menace. It made source segregation of plastic waste mandatory, with the ambition of following the ***waste-to-wealth*** pathway via recovery, recycling and reuse. It states that all the local bodies should be responsible for segregation, collection and processing and disposal of plastic waste. It recommended to phase out the production of non-recyclable multilayered single use plastic by March 2018.

Rules were further amended in 2018, with the provision of ***Extended Producer Responsibility*** in the plastic waste management system and to encourage a collect back system by the producers. It also recommended ways to ***gainfully use plastics*** - such as *in road construction.* Plastic waste can also be utilised for *energy recovery*, for the *waste-to-oil process*.

 
## Why we failed ?
But we have not been able to implement these rules, due to several issues such as - source segregation of waste remains a nightmare and a dirty prerogative of rag pickers who work in the informal sector; opposition from merchants and manufacturers - spur in black market of banned plastic polythenes; households' resistance to segregate the waste due to lack of awareness and will. Plastic producers have not put in place a system to collect back plastic waste from buyers and consumers. Residents and market associations prefer to remain blissfully unaware of rules. The recent COVID-19 crisis has again led to increased usage of single use plastic products such as PPE kits, face masks.

## Beacons of Hope

Amidst all this, there are individuals, societies, municipalities all over the country who have taken the responsibility to reduce the burden of plastic waste. From ***Afroz Shah*** cleaning the *Versova Beach* (clearing 9 million kg of garbage in 2 years) mobilising citizen participation, to ***Aditya Mukarji,*** a 15 year old Swatcch warrior, who convinced restaurants to give up plastic straws. The start-up ***Banyan Nation*** has helped global brands to use more recycled plastics. The ***Liter to Light*** initiative by Tripti Agarwal in Bangalore used discarded PET bottles to make a solar bulb that illuminates poor homes. ***Alag Karo*** initiative of Gurugram implemented by NGO Sahas, is an initiative to spread awareness about waste segregation at source and processing it further. The ***Madukkarai town*** in Tamil Nadu, achieved the status of being a *zero landfill town* - by co-processing the plastic waste into cement plants.

In 2008 the ***Rwandan*** government banned the manufacturing, use, sale and importation of all plastic bags and is one of the cleanest nations on the Earth. In 2002 the ***Irish*** government introduced a tax on plastic bags at points of sale, known as the “*PlasTax”*, which forced about 95% citizens to buy reusable cloth bags, thus giving up use of plastic bags. As of January 2017, most of ***Austria’s*** large supermarket chains have voluntarily stopped providing customers with free carrier bags (made from any kind of material).

## Alternatives to Plastic 
The use of ***biodegradable platewares*** from the fallen dried leaves of ***Areca palm trees*** in South India is a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to plastic styrofoam platewares.
***Paper water bottle*** made up of biodegradable pulp mixture of wheat straw, bamboo, husks, sugar cane, and/or bulrush. It can be converted to tissue paper, or writing paper after first use.
Use of ***aluminium cans*** which are infinitely recyclable, unlike plastics which can be recycled only 4-5 times 
Move to eco-friendly packaging options, by incorporating materials that has less impact on the planet - like ***newspaper packaging***


## Conclusion

Transitioning to more eco-friendly alternatives can be a lengthy process. In the meantime, strengthening circular economy and waste management systems can successfully help in reducing plastics pollution.

Citizens must act both as consumers and informed citizens - demanding sustainable products and embracing **sensible consumption habits** into their own lives such as using our own **reusable** cloth bags for shopping, giving up use of beauty products containing microbeads, bringing up their own coffee mug at work, asking restaurants you visit to stop using plastic straws etc.

Private sector must **innovate** by adopting business models that **eliminate** problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging through **redesign**, innovation, and new delivery models should be the priority.  

Governments must enact strong policies that push for a more **circular model of design** and production of plastics. Improvement in the Waste Management System is utmost important - Segregation of waste at sources : plastics, organic, metals, paper, etc.; effective collection of the segregated waste, transport and safe storage; Cost-effective recycling of materials (including plastics); Less landfilling and dumping in the environment.


> At last, success of any initiative ultimately depends upon the attitude of its stakeholders. Are you ready to change your attitude towards the use of plastic ?
