Another feather in Protection of women at workplace

Journalist **Priya Ramani's** acquittal in criminal defamation case filed against her by MJ Akbar, former Union Minister and Editor, is a landmark judgement by a Delhi Court in empowering women at Workplace. 

In 2018, **#MeToo** movement/campaign started. Subsequently, women across the world spoke about the sexual harassment faced by them. The movement brought out the ugly faces of many public dignitaries. The campaign resulted in conviction of powerful dignitaries such as Larry Nassar, comedian Bill Cosby and film producer Harvey Weinstein. 

Priya Ramani too accused MJ Akbar of sexual misconduct and harassment during a job interview around 20 years ago. Akbar resigned after facing such allegations. The allegations against Akbar were backed up by about 20 journalists. In retaliation, Akbar filed a criminal defamation case against Ramani for speaking up against him and tarnishing his "stellar reputation". 

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey in his 91 page judgement acquitting Ramani noted that - 
"A woman cannot be punished for raising voice against sex abuse on the pretext of criminal complaint of defamation". 

It said that - 
> "The Right of reputation cannot be protected at the cost of right of life and dignity as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution". 

He also underlined that :-
> "Women has the right to put her grievance on any platform of her choice... even after decades".

The Sexual Harassment Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and Vishakha guidelines of Supreme Court  provides protection to women against sexual predators at Workplace. The order affirms the spirit of these guidelines by upholding the right of a woman of safe and violence free work space. 

Pandey also stated that -- 
> "It cannot be ignored that most of the time, the offence of sexual harassment and sexual abuse are committed behind doors or privately. Sometimes victims do not understand what is happening is wrong. Despite how well respected some persons are in the society, they in their personal lives, could show extreme cruelty to the females"  

The court order will give spine to women to stand up against the powerful men, and will help them to defend their rights. It extends a legal shield to women speaking against sexual harassment, even when it happened decades ago. 

Most women do not speak up or report incidents of sexual harassment due to the social stigma attached to it. The sexual abuse takes away the self-confidence and dignity of women. Women should not remain silent and speak up firmly against unruly male sexual abusers. 

All male members reading this article, let's just take a pledge to protect and respect women and not indulge in any heinous act of sexual abuse against women. Women have the capability to create wonders. They just need freedom, safe space and equality at the workplace.
